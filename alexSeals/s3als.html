        <h2>SEALS</h2>
        <p>Seals are four limbed, fin footed, carnivorous, marine mammals. While they live both on land and in the water
        and they do require air to breathe, they are generally better adapted for water which is where they spend most
            of their time. Seals can both see and hear better in water. Though many look quite slick, all seals
        have fur coats except for walruses.</p>
        <h2>Seal Families</h2>
        <p>Seals have 3 main families: earless seals (also known as true seals), eared seals, and walrus.
        Both earless seals and eared seals have several varieties of seals included in their family, but while the
        family including the walrus once included many variations, it now is solely composed of the walrus.</p>

        <div class="families" id="earless">
            <p>Earless seals have two main subfamilies, northern seals and southern seals. All members of this family
                share the name seal, unlike sea lions or walruses.</p>

             the only freshwater seal.</p>

            <img src="./src/leopard-seal.jpg" alt="leopard seal" id="leopard-seal-img">
            <p>Leopard seals - A southern seal considered to be the deadliest seal. Fortunately, attacks on humans
                 are rare and there have even been a few friendly interactions between leopard seals and particularly
                lucky humans.</p>

            <img src="./src/elephant-seal.jpg" alt="elephant-seal" id="elephant-seal-img">
            <p>Elephant seals - There are two species of elephant seal, the northern and southern, which are both actually
                members of the southern seal subfamily. The southern elephant seal is the largest seal species, and can
                be up to 5.8 meters long.</p>

        <div class="families" id="eared">
            <p>Though sea lions and fur seals are seperated in name and some characteristics the two subgroups are both
                diverse enough within the group and similar enough between the two that a sea lion species may be closer
                related to a fur seal species than another sea lion species. For a long time these were the official
                subfamilies of eared seals, but currently there are no official subfamilies of eared seal, only genera.
                Of the two groups, sea lions are generally larger, and go on shorter foraging trips. The most notable
                difference though, is that fur seals have a thick underfur layer which sea lions lack.

            <p>California Sea Lions - California sea lions occupy most of the West coast of North
            America, including California. These sea lions have become fairly famous as they are highly intelligent
            and as a result can be trained, resulting in them being a common feature in marine wildlife shows.</p>

            <p>Stellar Sea Lions - The largest eared seal and the sole member of its genus.</p>
            <img src="" alt="stellar-sea-lion-img">
            <p>Northern Fur Seals - The northern fur seal is the sole living member of its genus and the largest
            of the fur seals. They are also the only fur seal which is not of the southern fur seal genus.</p>
            <img src="" alt="northern-fur-seal-img">
            <p>Hybrid seals - The classifications of eared seals can become particularly complex due to their genetic
            similarities. Sometimes hybrid seals are created, including cases of fertile hybrids. As species are defined
            by multiple means, this creates a minor contradiction to the very definition of species as a concept as
            for sexually reproducing animals the most common classification is of animals which can produce fertile
            offspring as one species, but these animals are geographically, and morphologically distinct enough that
                they would generally not be considered the same species.</p>
            <p>The southern sea lion and south american fur seal pictured bellow are two distinct species which produced
            a fertile hybrid
