            <h2>ORCAS</h2>
            <p>The orca (Orcinus orca), also called killer whale, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. It is the only extant species in the genus Orcinus and is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.</p>

            <h4>A group of orcas photographed in Norway (Todd Thimios)</h4>

            <p> Orcas are commonly referred to as "killer whales", despite being a type of dolphin. Since the 1960s, the use of "orca" instead of "killer whale" has steadily grown in common use.

                 As part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other oceanic dolphins than to other whales.</p>

            <p>Orcas can be identified by their very prominent saddle patch and specific different Killer Whales can be identified by unique nicks on their dorsal fins. This identification system allows researchers to keep an accurant annual count of living and surviving Orcas, to be able to better study them as well as preserve their future.</p>
            <h2>THE HUNT</h2>

            <p>Hunting is a core aspect of Orca culture and is as varied as it is necessary for them. Different orcas are in fact defined by their varied hunting techniques.
